#' We'll model the ridership on the Chicago elevated trains as a function of the 14 day lagged ridership at two stations. The two predictors are in the same units (rides per day/1000) and do not need to be normalized.

#' All but the last week of data are used for training. The last week will be predicted after the model is fit.
