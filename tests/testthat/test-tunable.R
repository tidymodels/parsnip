# general pattern, for each tunable method:
# define `spec`, run `show_engines()` with only parsnip loaded,
# snapshot test `tunable()` output for each unique engine.
#
# note that, as implemented, parsnip can return `tunable()` information
# for engines that it cannot fit without first loading an extension package.
#
# the specific contents of call_info are just hard-coded tibbles in the
# source, so snapshot testing only for their presence rather than contents.
