# Boosted trees via C5.0

`C5.0_train` is a wrapper for the `C5.0()` function in the C50 package
that fits tree-based models where all of the model arguments are in the
main function.

## Usage

``` r
C5.0_train(x, y, weights = NULL, trials = 15, minCases = 2, sample = 0, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A data frame or matrix of predictors.

- y:

  A factor vector with 2 or more levels

- weights:

  An optional numeric vector of case weights. Note that the data used
  for the case weights will not be used as a splitting variable in the
  model (see `https://www.rulequest.com/see5-info.html` for Quinlan's
  notes on case weights).

- trials:

  An integer specifying the number of boosting iterations. A value of
  one indicates that a single model is used.

- minCases:

  An integer for the smallest number of samples that must be put in at
  least two of the splits.

- sample:

  A value between (0, .999) that specifies the random proportion of the
  data should be used to train the model. By default, all the samples
  are used for model training. Samples not used for training are used to
  evaluate the accuracy of the model in the printed output. A value of
  zero means that all the training data are used.

- ...:

  Other arguments to pass.

## Value

A fitted C5.0 model.
