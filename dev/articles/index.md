- [Introduction to
  parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/parsnip.md):

  The goal of parsnip is to provide a tidy, unified interface to models
  to avoid getting bogged down in the syntactical minutiae of the
  underlying software.

- [Evaluating submodels with the same model
  object](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/Submodels.md):

  You can use
  [`multi_predict()`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/dev/reference/multi_predict.md)
  to evaluate submodels with the same model object and avoid having to
  fit any of the submodels.
