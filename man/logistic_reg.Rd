\title{Logistic regression}
\usage{
logistic_reg(
  mode = "classification",
  engine = "glm",
  penalty = NULL,
  mixture = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the type of model.
The only possible value for this model is "classification".}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting. Possible engines are listed below. The default for this
model is \code{"glm"}.}

\item{penalty}{A non-negative number representing the total
amount of regularization (specific engines only).
For \code{keras} models, this corresponds to purely L2 regularization
(aka weight decay) while the other models can be either or a combination
of L1 and L2 (depending on the value of \code{mixture}).}

\item{mixture}{A number between zero and one (inclusive) that is the
proportion of L1 regularization (i.e. lasso) in the model. When
\code{mixture = 1}, it is a pure lasso model while \code{mixture = 0} indicates that
ridge regression is being used. (specific engines only).
For \code{LiblineaR} models, \code{mixture} must be exactly 0 or 1 only.}

\description{
\code{\link[=logistic_reg]{logistic_reg()}} defines a generalized linear model for binary outcomes. A
linear combination of the predictors is used to model the log odds of an
event.

There are different ways to fit this model. The method of estimation is
chosen by setting the model \emph{engine}.

}
\details{
This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
