\usage{
gen_additive_mod(
  mode = "unknown",
  select_features = NULL,
  adjust_deg_free = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the prediction outcome mode.
Possible values for this model are "unknown", "regression", or
"classification".}

\item{select_features}{TRUE or FALSE. If this is TRUE then can add an
extra penalty to each term so that it can be penalized to zero.
This means that the smoothing parameter estimation that is part of
fitting can completely remove terms from the model. If the corresponding
smoothing parameter is estimated as zero then the extra penalty has no effect.
Use \code{adjust_deg_free} to increase level of penalization.}

\item{adjust_deg_free}{If \code{select_features = TRUE}, then acts as a multiplier for smoothness.
Increase this beyond 1 to produce smoother models.}
}
\value{
A \code{parsnip} model specification
}
\description{
\code{gen_additive_mod()} defines a model that can use smoothed functions of
numeric predictors in a generalized linear model.
}
\details{
There are different ways to fit this model. See the engine-specific pages
for more details

More information on how \code{parsnip} is used for modeling is at
\url{https://www.tidymodels.org}.

This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.

\strong{gam}

This engine uses \code{\link[mgcv:gam]{mgcv::gam()}} and has the following parameters,
which can be modified through the \code{\link[=set_engine]{set_engine()}} function.\preformatted{## function (formula, family = gaussian(), data = list(), weights = NULL, 
##     subset = NULL, na.action, offset = NULL, method = "GCV.Cp", optimizer = c("outer", 
##         "newton"), control = list(), scale = 0, select = FALSE, knots = NULL, 
##     sp = NULL, min.sp = NULL, H = NULL, gamma = 1, fit = TRUE, paraPen = NULL, 
##     G = NULL, in.out = NULL, drop.unused.levels = TRUE, drop.intercept = NULL, 
##     discrete = FALSE, ...)
}
}
\section{Fit Details}{


\strong{MGCV Formula Interface}

Fitting GAMs is accomplished using parameters including:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[mgcv:s]{mgcv::s()}}: GAM spline smooths
\item \code{\link[mgcv:te]{mgcv::te()}}: GAM tensor product smooths
}

These are applied in the \code{fit()} function:\if{html}{\out{<div class="r">}}\preformatted{fit(value ~ s(date_mon, k = 12) + s(date_num), data = df)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
