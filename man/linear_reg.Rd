\title{Linear regression}
\usage{
linear_reg(mode = "regression", engine = "lm", penalty = NULL, mixture = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the type of model.
The only possible value for this model is "regression".}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting. Possible engines are listed below. The default for this
model is \code{"lm"}.}

\item{penalty}{A non-negative number representing the total
amount of regularization (specific engines only).}

\item{mixture}{A number between zero and one (inclusive) that is the
proportion of L1 regularization (i.e. lasso) in the model. When
\code{mixture = 1}, it is a pure lasso model while \code{mixture = 0} indicates that
ridge regression is being used (specific engines only).}
}
\description{
\code{linear_reg()} defines a model that can predict numeric values from
predictors using a linear function.

There are different ways to fit this model. The method of estimation is
chosen by setting the model \emph{engine}.

}
\details{
This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
