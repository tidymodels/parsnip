\usage{
nearest_neighbor(
  mode = "unknown",
  engine = "kknn",
  neighbors = NULL,
  weight_func = NULL,
  dist_power = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the prediction outcome mode.
Possible values for this model are "unknown", "regression", or
"classification".}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting.}

\item{neighbors}{A single integer for the number of neighbors
to consider (often called \code{k}). For \pkg{kknn}, a value of 5
is used if \code{neighbors} is not specified.}

\item{weight_func}{A \emph{single} character for the type of kernel function used
to weight distances between samples. Valid choices are: \code{"rectangular"},
\code{"triangular"}, \code{"epanechnikov"}, \code{"biweight"}, \code{"triweight"},
\code{"cos"}, \code{"inv"}, \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"rank"}, or \code{"optimal"}.}

\item{dist_power}{A single number for the parameter used in
calculating Minkowski distance.}
}
\description{
\code{nearest_neighbor()} defines a model that uses the \code{K} most similar data
points from the training set to predict new samples.

There are different ways to fit this model. The method of estimation is
chosen by setting the model \emph{engine}.

}
\details{
This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
