```{r, child = "aaa.Rmd", include = FALSE}
```

`r descr_models("logistic_reg", "glm")`

## Tuning Parameters

This engine has no tuning parameters but you can set the `family` parameter (and/or `link`) as an engine argument (see below). 

## Translation from parsnip to the original package

```{r glm-reg}
logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm") %>% 
  translate()
```

To use a non-default `family` and/or `link`, pass in as an argument to `set_engine()`:

```{r glm-reg-engine}
linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm", family = stats::binomial(link = "probit")) %>% 
  translate()
```

## Preprocessing requirements

```{r child = "template-makes-dummies.Rmd"}
```

## Case weights

```{r child = "template-uses-case-weights.Rmd"}
```

_However_, the documentation in [stats::glm()] assumes that is specific type of case weights are being used:"Non-NULL weights can be used to indicate that different observations have different dispersions (with the values in weights being inversely proportional to the dispersions); or equivalently, when the elements of weights are positive integers `w_i`, that each response `y_i` is the mean of `w_i` unit-weight observations. For a binomial GLM prior weights are used to give the number of trials when the response is the proportion of successes: they would rarely be used for a Poisson GLM."

## Examples 

The "Fitting and Predicting with parsnip" article contains [examples](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/articles/articles/Examples.html#logistic-reg-glm) for `logistic_reg()` with the `"glm"` engine.
