```{r, child = "aaa.Rmd", include = FALSE}
```

`r descr_models("linear_reg", "glmer")`

## Tuning Parameters

This model has no tuning parameters.

## Translation from parsnip to the original package

`r uses_extension("linear_reg", "glmer", "regression")`

```{r glmer-reg}
library(multilevelmod)

linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glmer") %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>% 
  translate()
```

Note that using this engine with a linear link function will result in a warning:

```
calling glmer() with family=gaussian (identity link) as a shortcut 
to lmer() is deprecated; please call lmer() directly
```


```{r child = "template-no-pooling.Rmd"}
```

## Preprocessing requirements

There are no specific preprocessing needs. However, it is helpful to keep the clustering/subject identifier column as factor or character (instead of making them into dummy variables). See the examples in the next section. 

## Other details

The model can accept case weights. 

With parsnip, we suggest using the formula method when fitting: 

```r
library(tidymodels)
data("riesby")

linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glmer") %>% 
  fit(depr_score ~ week + (1|subject), data = riesby)
```

When using tidymodels infrastructure, it may be better to use a workflow. In this case, you can add the appropriate columns using `add_variables()` then supply the typical formula when adding the model: 

```r
library(tidymodels)

glmer_spec <- 
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glmer")

glmer_wflow <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  # The data are included as-is using:
  add_variables(outcomes = depr_score, predictors = c(week, subject)) %>% 
  add_model(glmer_spec, formula = depr_score ~ week + (1|subject))

fit(glmer_wflow, data = riesby)
```

## Case weights

```{r child = "template-uses-case-weights.Rmd"}
```
