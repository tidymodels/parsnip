# Engine Details

```{r, child = "setup.Rmd", include = FALSE}
```

Engines may have pre-set default arguments when executing the model fit call. 
For this type of model, the template of the fit calls are below:

## LiblineaR

```{r LiblineaR-reg}
svm_linear() %>% 
  set_engine("LiblineaR") %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>% 
  translate()
```

```{r LiblineaR-cls}
svm_linear() %>% 
  set_engine("LiblineaR") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  translate()
```

Note that the `LiblineaR` engine cannot produce class probabilities. When 
optimizing the model using the `tune` package, the default metrics require class 
probabilities. To be able to use the `tune_*()` functions, a metric set must be 
passed as an argument and it can only contain metrics associated with hard class 
predictions (e.g., accuracy and so on). 

This engine fits models that are L2-regularized for L2-loss. In the `LiblineaR` 
documentation, these are types 1 (classification) and 11 (regression).

## kernlab

```{r kernlab-reg}
svm_linear() %>% 
  set_engine("kernlab") %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>% 
  translate()
```

```{r kernlab-cls}
svm_linear() %>% 
  set_engine("kernlab") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  translate()
```

`fit()` passes the data directly to `kernlab::ksvm()` so that its formula method can create dummy variables as-needed. 


## Parameter translations

The standardized parameter names in parsnip can be mapped to their original 
names in each engine that has main parameters. Each engine typically has a 
different default value (shown in parentheses) for each parameter.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
## these values were manually checked :/ on 2021-02-01
get_defaults_svm_linear <- function() {
  tibble::tribble(
    ~model,    ~engine,       ~parsnip,        ~original,  ~default,
    "svm_linear", "LiblineaR",   "cost",          "C",        "1",
    "svm_linear", "LiblineaR",   "margin",        "svr_eps",  "0.1",
    "svm_linear", "kernlab",     "cost",          "C",        "1",
    "svm_linear", "kernlab",     "margin",        "epsilon",  "0.1",
  )
}
convert_args("svm_linear")
```
