```{r, child = "aaa.Rmd", include = FALSE}
```

`r descr_models("proportional_hazards", "survival")`

## Tuning Parameters

This model has no tuning parameters.

## Translation from parsnip to the original package

`r uses_extension("proportional_hazards", "survival", "censored regression")`

```{r survival-creg}
library(censored)

proportional_hazards() %>% 
  set_engine("survival") %>% 
  set_mode("censored regression") %>% 
  translate()
```

## Other details

The model does not fit an intercept. 

The main interface for this model uses the formula method since the model specification typically involved the use of [survival::Surv()]. 

The model formula can include _special_ terms, such as [survival::strata()]. The allows the baseline hazard to differ between groups contained in the function. The column used inside `strata()` is treated as qualitative no matter its type. To learn more about using special terms in formulas with tidymodels, see [`?model_formula`][parsnip::model_formula].

For example, in this model, the numeric column `rx` is used to estimate two different baseline hazards for each value of the column:

```{r}
library(survival)

proportional_hazards() %>% 
  fit(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ age + strata(rx), data = ovarian) %>% 
  extract_fit_engine() %>% 
  # Two different hazards for each value of 'rx'
  basehaz()
```

Note that columns used in the `strata()` function will not be estimated in the regular portion of the model (i.e., within the linear predictor).

```{r child = "template-survival-mean.Rmd"}
```

## Linear predictor values

```{r child = "template-censored-linear-predictor.Rmd"}
```

## Case weights

```{r child = "template-uses-case-weights.Rmd"}
```
