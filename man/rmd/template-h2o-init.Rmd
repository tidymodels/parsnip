To use the h2o engine with tidymodels, please run `h2o::h2o.init()` first. By default, This connects R to the local h2o server. This needs to be done in every new R session. You can also connect to a remote h2o server with an IP address, for more details see [h2o::h2o.init()]. 

You can control the number of threads in the thread pool used by h2o with the `nthreads` argument. By default, it uses all CPUs on the host. This is different from the usual parallel processing mechanism in tidymodels for tuning, while tidymodels parallelizes over resamples, h2o parallelizes over hyperparameter combinations for a given resample. 

h2o will automatically shut down the local h2o instance started by R when R is terminated. To manually stop the h2o server, run `h2o::h2o.shutdown()`.
