The `mtry` argument denotes the number of predictors that will be randomly sampled at each split when creating tree models. 

Some engines, such as `"xgboost"`, `"xrf"`, and `"lightgbm"`, interpret their analogue to the `mtry` argument as the _proportion_ of predictors that will be randomly sampled at each split rather than the _count_. In some settings, such as when tuning over preprocessors that influence the number of predictors, this parameterization is quite helpful---interpreting `mtry` as a proportion means that $[0, 1]$ is always a valid range for that parameter, regardless of input data.

parsnip and its extensions accommodate this parameterization using the `counts` argument: a logical indicating whether `mtry` should be interpreted as the number of predictors that will be randomly sampled at each split. `TRUE` indicates that `mtry` will be interpreted in its sense as a count, `FALSE` indicates that the argument will be interpreted in its sense as a proportion.

`mtry` is a main model argument for \\code{\\link[=boost_tree]{boost_tree()}} and \\code{\\link[=rand_forest]{rand_forest()}}, and thus should not have an engine-specific interface. So, regardless of engine, `counts` defaults to `TRUE`. For engines that support the proportion interpretation---currently `"xgboost"`, `"xrf"` (via the rules package), and `"lightgbm"` (via the bonsai package)---the user can pass the `counts = FALSE` argument to `set_engine()` to supply `mtry` values within $[0, 1]$.
