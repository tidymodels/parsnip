```{r, child = "setup.Rmd", include = FALSE}
```

`r descr_models("linear_reg", "lmer")`

## Tuning Parameters

This model has no tuning parameters.

## Translation from parsnip to the original package

```{r lmer-csl}
linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lmer") %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>% 
  translate()
```

```{r child = "no-pooling.Rmd"}
```

## Preprocessing requirements

There are no specific preprocessing needs. However, it is helpful to keep the clustering/subject identifier column as factor or character (instead of making them into dummy variables). See the examples in the next section. 

## Other details

The model can accept case weights. 

With `parsnip`, we suggest using the formula method when fitting: 

```r
library(tidymodels)
data("riesby")

linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lmer") %>% 
  fit(depr_score ~ week + (1|subject), data = riesby)
```

When using the general tidymodels infrastructure, it may be better to use a workflow. In this case, you can add the appropriate columns using `add_variables()` then supply the typical formula when adding the model: 

```r
library(tidymodels)

lmer_spec <- 
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lmer")

lmer_wflow <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  # The data are included as-is using:
  add_variables(outcomes = depr_score, predictors = c(week, subject)) %>% 
  add_model(lmer_spec, formula = depr_score ~ week + (1|subject))

fit(lmer_wflow, data = riesby)
```
