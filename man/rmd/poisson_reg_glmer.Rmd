```{r, child = "setup.Rmd", include = FALSE}
```

`r descr_models("poisson_reg", "glmer")`

## Tuning Parameters

This model has no tuning parameters.

## Translation from parsnip to the original package

```{r lmer-csl}
poisson_reg(engine = "glmer") %>% 
  set_engine("glmer") %>% 
  translate()
```

```{r child = "no-pooling.Rmd"}
```

## Preprocessing requirements

There are no specific preprocessing needs. However, it is helpful to keep the clustering/subject identifier column as factor or character (instead of making them into dummy variables). See the examples in the next section. 

## Other details

The model can accept case weights. 

With `parsnip`, we suggest using the formula method when fitting: 

```r
library(tidymodels)

poisson_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glmer") %>% 
  fit(y ~ time + x + (1 | subject), data = longitudinal_counts)
```

When using the general tidymodels infrastructure, it may be better to use a workflow. In this case, you can add the appropriate columns using `add_variables()` then supply the typical formula when adding the model: 

```r
library(tidymodels)

glmer_spec <- 
  poisson_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glmer")

glmer_wflow <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  # The data are included as-is using:
  add_variables(outcomes = y, predictors = c(time, x, subject)) %>% 
  add_model(glmer_spec, formula = y ~ time + x + (1 | subject))

fit(glmer_wflow, data = longitudinal_counts)
```
