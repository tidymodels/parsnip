For this engine, there is a single mode: classification

## Tuning Parameters



This model has 1 tuning parameters:

- `min_n`: Minimal Node Size (type: integer, default: 2L)

## Translation from parsnip to the original package (classification)


```r
decision_tree(min_n = integer()) %>% 
  set_engine("C5.0") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  translate()
```

```
## Decision Tree Model Specification (classification)
## 
## Main Arguments:
##   min_n = integer()
## 
## Computational engine: C5.0 
## 
## Model fit template:
## parsnip::C5.0_train(x = missing_arg(), y = missing_arg(), weights = missing_arg(), 
##     minCases = integer(), trials = 1)
```

[C5.0_train()] is a wrapper around [C50::C5.0()] that makes it easier to run this model.

## Preprocessing requirements


This engine does not require any special encoding of the predictors. Categorical predictors can be partitioned into groups of factor levels (e.g. `{a, c}` vs `{b, d}`) when splitting at a node. Dummy variables are not required for this model. 

## Case weights


This model can utilize case weights during model fitting. To use them, see the documentation in [case_weights] and the examples on `tidymodels.org`. 

The `fit()` and `fit_xy()` arguments have arguments called `case_weights` that expect vectors of case weights. 

## Examples 

The "Fitting and Predicting with parsnip" article contains [examples](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/articles/articles/Examples.html#decision-tree-C5.0) for `decision_tree()` with the `"C5.0"` engine.
