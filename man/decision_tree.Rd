\usage{
decision_tree(
  mode = "unknown",
  engine = "rpart",
  cost_complexity = NULL,
  tree_depth = NULL,
  min_n = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the prediction outcome mode.
Possible values for this model are "unknown", "regression", or
"classification".}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting.}

\item{cost_complexity}{A positive number for the the cost/complexity
parameter (a.k.a. \code{Cp}) used by CART models (specific engines only).}

\item{tree_depth}{An integer for maximum depth of the tree.}

\item{min_n}{An integer for the minimum number of data points
in a node that are required for the node to be split further.}
}
\description{
\code{decision_tree()} defines a model as a set of \verb{if/then} statements that
creates a tree-based structure.

There are different ways to fit this model. The method of estimation is
chosen by setting the model \emph{engine}.

}
\details{
This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
