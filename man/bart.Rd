\usage{
bart(
  mode = "unknown",
  engine = "dbarts",
  trees = NULL,
  prior_terminal_node_coef = NULL,
  prior_terminal_node_expo = NULL,
  prior_outcome_range = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the prediction outcome mode.
Possible values for this model are "unknown", "regression", or
"classification".}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting.}

\item{trees}{An integer for the number of trees contained in
the ensemble.}

\item{prior_terminal_node_coef}{A coefficient for the prior probability that
a node is a terminal node. Values are usually between 0 and one with
a default of 0.95. This affects the baseline probability; smaller numbers
make the probabilities larger overall. See Details below.}

\item{prior_terminal_node_expo}{An exponent in the prior probability that
a node is a terminal node.  Values are usually non-negative with
a default of 2 This affects the rate that the prior probability decreases as
the depth of the tree increases. Larger values make deeper trees less likely.}

\item{prior_outcome_range}{A positive value that defines the width of a prior
that the predicted outcome is within a certain range. For regression it is
related to the observed range of the data; the prior is the number of standard
deviations of a Gaussian distribution defined by the observed range of the
data. For classification, it is defined as the range of +/-3 (assumed to be
on the logit scale). The default value is 2.}
}
\description{
\code{bart()} defines a tree ensemble model that uses Bayesian analysis to
assemble the ensemble.

There are different ways to fit this model. See the engine-specific pages
for more details:

\Sexpr[stage=render,results=rd]{parsnip:::make_engine_list("bart")}

More information on how \pkg{parsnip} is used for modeling is at
\url{https://www.tidymodels.org/}.
}
\details{
The prior for the terminal node probability is expressed as
\code{prior = a * (1 + d)^(-b)} where \code{d} is the depth of the node, \code{a} is
\code{prior_terminal_node_coef} and \code{b} is \code{prior_terminal_node_expo}. See the
Examples section below for an example graph of the prior probability of a
terminal node for different values of these parameters.

This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
