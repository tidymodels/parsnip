\title{Poisson regression via glm}
\description{
\code{\link[stats:glm]{stats::glm()}} uses maximum likelihood to fit a model for count data.
}
\details{
For this engine, there is a single mode: regression
\subsection{Tuning Parameters}{

This engine has no tuning parameters.
}

\subsection{Translation from parsnip to the underlying model call (regression)}{

The \strong{poissonreg} extension package is required to fit this model.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{## Poisson Regression Model Specification (regression)
## 
## Computational engine: glm 
## 
## Model fit template:
## stats::glm(formula = missing_arg(), data = missing_arg(), weights = missing_arg(), 
##     family = stats::poisson)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\subsection{Preprocessing requirements}{

Factor/categorical predictors need to be converted to numeric values
(e.g., dummy or indicator variables) for this engine. When using the
formula method via \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit()}}, parsnip
will convert factor columns to indicators.
}

\subsection{Case weights}{

This model can utilize case weights during model fitting. To use them,
see the documentation in \link{case_weights} and the examples
on \code{tidymodels.org}.

The \code{fit()} and \code{fit_xy()} arguments have arguments called
\code{case_weights} that expect vectors of case weights.

The \code{fit()} and \code{fit_xy()} arguments have arguments called

\emph{However}, the documentation in \code{\link[stats:glm]{stats::glm()}} assumes
that is specific type of case weights are being used:“Non-NULL weights
can be used to indicate that different observations have different
dispersions (with the values in weights being inversely proportional to
the dispersions); or equivalently, when the elements of weights are
positive integers \code{w_i}, that each response \code{y_i} is the mean of \code{w_i}
unit-weight observations. For a binomial GLM prior weights are used to
give the number of trials when the response is the proportion of
successes: they would rarely be used for a Poisson GLM.”

If frequency weights are being used in your application, the
\code{\link[=glm_grouped]{glm_grouped()}} model (and corresponding engine) may be
more appropriate.
