\usage{
naive_Bayes(
  mode = "classification",
  smoothness = NULL,
  Laplace = NULL,
  engine = "klaR"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the prediction outcome mode.
Possible values for this model are "unknown", "regression", or
"classification".}

\item{smoothness}{An non-negative number representing the the relative
smoothness of the class boundary. Smaller examples result in model flexible
boundaries and larger values generate class boundaries that are less
adaptable}

\item{Laplace}{A non-negative value for the Laplace correction to smoothing
low-frequency counts.}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting.}
}
\description{
\code{naive_Bayes()} defines a model that uses Bayes' theorem to compute the
probability of each class, given the predictor values.

There are different ways to fit this model. The method of estimation is
chosen by setting the model \emph{engine}.

}
\details{
This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
