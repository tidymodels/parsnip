\usage{
mlp(
  mode = "unknown",
  engine = "nnet",
  hidden_units = NULL,
  penalty = NULL,
  dropout = NULL,
  epochs = NULL,
  activation = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the prediction outcome mode.
Possible values for this model are "unknown", "regression", or
"classification".}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting.}

\item{hidden_units}{An integer for the number of units in the hidden model.}

\item{penalty}{A non-negative numeric value for the amount of weight
decay.}

\item{dropout}{A number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 denoting the proportion
of model parameters randomly set to zero during model training.}

\item{epochs}{An integer for the number of training iterations.}

\item{activation}{A single character string denoting the type of relationship
between the original predictors and the hidden unit layer. The activation
function between the hidden and output layers is automatically set to either
"linear" or "softmax" depending on the type of outcome. Possible values are:
"linear", "softmax", "relu", and "elu"}
}
\description{
\code{mlp()} defines a multilayer perceptron model (a.k.a. a single layer,
feed-forward neural network).

There are different ways to fit this model. The method of estimation is
chosen by setting the model \emph{engine}.

\Sexpr[stage=render,results=rd]{parsnip:::make_engine_list("mlp")}

More information on how \pkg{parsnip} is used for modeling is at
\url{https://www.tidymodels.org/}.
}
\details{
This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
