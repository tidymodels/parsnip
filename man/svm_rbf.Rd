\title{Radial basis function support vector machines}
\usage{
svm_rbf(mode = "unknown", cost = NULL, rbf_sigma = NULL, margin = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the type of model.
Possible values for this model are "unknown", "regression", or
"classification".}

\item{cost}{A positive number for the cost of predicting a sample within
or on the wrong side of the margin}

\item{rbf_sigma}{A positive number for radial basis function.}

\item{margin}{A positive number for the epsilon in the SVM insensitive
loss function (regression only)}
}
\description{
\code{svm_rbf()} defines a support vector machine model. For classification,
these models try to maximize the width of the margin between classes.
For regression, the model optimizes a robust loss function that is only
affected by very large model residuals.

This SVM model uses a nonlinear function, defined by the radial basis function,
to create the decision boundary or regression line.

There are different ways to fit this model. See the engine-specific pages
for more details:

\Sexpr[stage=render,results=rd]{parsnip:::make_engine_list("svm_rbf")}

}
\details{
This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
