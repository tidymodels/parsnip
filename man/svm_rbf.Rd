\usage{
svm_rbf(
  mode = "unknown",
  engine = "kernlab",
  cost = NULL,
  rbf_sigma = NULL,
  margin = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the prediction outcome mode.
Possible values for this model are "unknown", "regression", or
"classification".}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting. Possible engines are listed below. The default for this
model is \code{"kernlab"}.}

\item{cost}{A positive number for the cost of predicting a sample within
or on the wrong side of the margin}

\item{rbf_sigma}{A positive number for radial basis function.}

\item{margin}{A positive number for the epsilon in the SVM insensitive
loss function (regression only)}
}
\description{
\code{svm_rbf()} defines a support vector machine model. For classification,
the model tries to maximize the width of the margin between classes.
For regression, the model optimizes a robust loss function that is only
affected by very large model residuals.

This SVM model uses a nonlinear function, specifically the radial basis function,
to create the decision boundary or regression line.

There are different ways to fit this model. The method of estimation is
chosen by setting the model \emph{engine}.

\details{
This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
