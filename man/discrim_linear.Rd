\usage{
discrim_linear(
  mode = "classification",
  penalty = NULL,
  regularization_method = NULL,
  engine = "MASS"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the type of model. The only
possible value for this model is "classification".}

\item{penalty}{An non-negative number representing the amount of
regularization used by some of the engines.}

\item{regularization_method}{A character string for the type of regularized
estimation. Possible values are: "\code{diagonal}", "\code{min_distance}",
"\code{shrink_cov}", and "\code{shrink_mean}" (\code{sparsediscrim} engine only).}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting.}
}
\description{
\code{discrim_linear()} defines a model that estimates a multivariate
distribution for the predictors separately for the data in each class
(usually Gaussian with a common covariance matrix). Bayes' theorem is used
to compute the probability of each class, given the predictor values.

There are different ways to fit this model. The method of estimation is
chosen by setting the model \emph{engine}.

}
\details{
This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
