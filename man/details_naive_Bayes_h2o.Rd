\title{Naive Bayes models via naivebayes}
\description{
\code{\link[h2o:h2o.naiveBayes]{h2o::h2o.naiveBayes()}} fits a model that uses Bayes' theorem to compute
the probability of each class, given the predictor values.
}
\details{
For this engine, there is a single mode: classification
\subsection{Tuning Parameters}{

This model has 1 tuning parameter:
\itemize{
\item \code{Laplace}: Laplace Correction (type: double, default: 0.0)
}

\code{\link[h2o:h2o.naiveBayes]{h2o::h2o.naiveBayes()}} provides several engine
arguments to deal with imbalances and rare classes:
\itemize{
\item \code{balance_classes} A logical value controlling over/under-sampling (for
imbalanced data). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{class_sampling_factors} The over/under-sampling ratios per class (in
lexicographic order). If not specified, sampling factors will be
automatically computed to obtain class balance during training.
Require \code{balance_classes} to be \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{min_sdev}: The minimum standard deviation to use for observations
without enough data, must be greater than 1e-10.
\item \code{min_prob}: The minimum probability to use for observations with not
enough data.
}
}

\subsection{Translation from parsnip to the original package}{

The \strong{agua} extension package is required to fit this model.

\code{\link[agua:h2o_train]{agua::h2o_train_nb()}} is a wrapper around
\code{\link[h2o:h2o.naiveBayes]{h2o::h2o.naiveBayes()}}.

\subsection{Initializing h2o}{

To use the h2o engine with tidymodels, please run \code{h2o::h2o.init()}
first. By default, This connects R to the local h2o server. This needs
to be done in every new R session. You can also connect to a remote h2o
server with an IP address, for more details see
\code{\link[h2o:h2o.init]{h2o::h2o.init()}}.

You can control the number of threads in the thread pool used by h2o
with the \code{nthreads} argument. By default, it uses all CPUs on the host.
This is different from the usual parallel processing mechanism in
tidymodels for tuning, while tidymodels parallelizes over resamples, h2o
parallelizes over hyperparameter combinations for a given resample.

h2o will automatically shut down the local h2o instance started by R
when R is terminated. To manually stop the h2o server, run
\code{h2o::h2o.shutdown()}.
}

\subsection{Saving fitted model objects}{

Models fitted with this engine may require native serialization methods
to be properly saved and/or passed between R sessions. To learn more
about preparing fitted models for serialization, see the bundle package.
