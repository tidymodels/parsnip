\usage{
mars(
  mode = "unknown",
  engine = "earth",
  num_terms = NULL,
  prod_degree = NULL,
  prune_method = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the prediction outcome mode.
Possible values for this model are "unknown", "regression", or
"classification".}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting.}

\item{num_terms}{The number of features that will be retained in the
final model, including the intercept.}

\item{prod_degree}{The highest possible interaction degree.}

\item{prune_method}{The pruning method.}
}
\description{
\code{mars()} defines a generalized linear model that uses artificial features for
some predictors. These features resemble hinge functions and the result is
a model that is a segmented regression in small dimensions.

There are different ways to fit this model. The method of estimation is
chosen by setting the model \emph{engine}.

}
\details{
This function only defines what \emph{type} of model is being fit. Once an engine
is specified, the \emph{method} to fit the model is also defined.

The model is not trained or fit until the \code{\link[=fit.model_spec]{fit.model_spec()}} function is used
with the data.
