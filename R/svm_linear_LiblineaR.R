#' Linear support vector machines (SVMs) via LiblineaR
#'
#' [LiblineaR::LiblineaR()] fits a support vector machine model. For classification,
#' the model tries to maximize the width of the margin between classes.
#' For regression, the model optimizes a robust loss function that is only
#' affected by very large model residuals.
