#' Using case weights with parsnip
#'
#' Case weights are positive numeric values that influence how much each data
#' point has during the model fitting process. There are a variety of situations
#' where case weights can be used.
#'
#' tidymodels packages differentiate _how_ different types of case weights
#' should be used during the entire data analysis process, including
#' preprocessing data, model fitting, performance calculations, etc.
#'
#' The tidymodels packages require users to convert their numeric vectors to a
#' vector class that reflects how these should be used. For example, there are
#' some situations where the weights should not affect operations such as
#' centering and scaling or other preprocessing operations.
#'
#' The types of weights allowed in tidymodels are:
#'
#' * Frequency weights via [hardhat::frequency_weights()]
#' * Importance weights via [hardhat::importance_weights()]
#'
#' More types can be added by request.
#'
#' For parsnip, the [fit()] and [fit_xy] functions contain a `case_weight`
#' argument that takes these data. For Spark models, the argument value should
#' be a character value.
