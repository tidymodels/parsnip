#' Regularized discriminant analysis via klaR
#'
#' [klaR::rda()] fits a a model that estimates a multivariate
#'  distribution for the predictors separately for the data in each class. The
#'  structure of the model can be LDA, QDA, or some amalgam of the two. Bayes'
#'  theorem is used to compute the probability of each class, given the
#'  predictor values.
