#' Polynomial support vector machines (SVMs) via kernlab
#'
#' [kernlab::ksvm()] fits a support vector machine model. For classification,
#' these models try to maximize the width of the margin between classes.
#' For regression, the model optimizes a robust loss function that is only
#' affected by the largest model residuals.
