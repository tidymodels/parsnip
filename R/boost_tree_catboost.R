#' Boosted trees via catboost
#'
#' `catboost::catboost.train()` creates a series of decision trees
#'  forming an ensemble. Each tree depends on the results of previous trees.
#'  All trees in the ensemble are combined to produce a final prediction.
#'  catboost has native support for categorical predictors.
